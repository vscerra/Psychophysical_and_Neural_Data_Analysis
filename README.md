# Psychophysical_and_Neural_Data_Analysis
Data files, analysis and ETL scripts from work on easy and urgent decision-making tasks

This repository will serve for the work I conducted at Wake Forest University. All data was collected in the lab and under the guidance of Terrence Stanford and Emilio Salinas. All data was collected by Veronica Scerra (me) and all ETL and analysis was scripted by Veronica Scerra (me). 

Delayed Saccade Task. 
This task is a standard perceptual task in which the subject fixates at the center of the screen, followed by a period of target appearance (O+A). The signal to saccade to target is the extinguishing of the fixation point. Subjects were trained extensively on this task, and in the context of neural data collection, target location was varied to help identify recorded neural receptive fields.
